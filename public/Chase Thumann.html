      Chaliaskarov Hikodim Tharasovich is most well known for his performance as a high-school age student "Charles Thumann". The character (sometimes referred to as "Chase") is an attendee of Harvard-Westlake Upper School. His work as Chase began in 2002 where he gruesomely performed a realistic depiction of his birth. This fully immersive performance as an american child will soon come to an end after 18 years, for Chaliaskarov wishes to retire and return to Russia to see his wife and children after so many years.
